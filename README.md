# electron-screen-recorder
This is an Electron (nodeJS) app that takes whatever you are doing on a window or the whole screen and records it just as OBS would do.

This repository will only save the source files so to start the Electron project, one needs to do the following:

* Have an editor such as MS VSCode, npm and git installed
On VSCode terminal or system terminal, type 'npx create-electron-app your-app's-name'. This will install the dependencies.

* To run the project, you can type 'npm start' and 'rs' to restart, on the VSCode terminal.
